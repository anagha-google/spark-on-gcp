# Serverless Spark on GCP

This repository contains a hands on lab with multiple modules and covers serverless Spark on GCP powered by Dataproc. 

### Audience
The intended audience is Google Customer Engineers but anyone with access to GCP can try the lab modules just as well.

### Prerequisites
The lab covers setup in Argolis, therefore Argolis enablement is prerequisite

### Goal
(a) Just enough knowledge of serverless Spark on GCP powered by Dataproc to field customer conversations, (b) completed setup in Argolis for serverless Spark, (c) basic/quickstart demos and knowledge of how to run them and (d) knowledge of resources for serverless Spark on GCP.

### What is covered?
Currently, the labs are very basic to get quick started on serverless Spark on GCP. More advanced labs will be added eventually.
